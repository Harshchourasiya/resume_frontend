In the small room. A boy with black hair who is around 22 year sitting on the chair in front of the study table.
He is doing nothing, only looking at the screen of the laptop which is in front on him. he have an annoying look on this face.

"Hell, Where were I put my resumes I remember creating a folder but where was it is?"

"Here, it is, Okay Now that, I find it. I will improve my resume. I don't get it Why my resume is not getting selected"

"I need to find a PDF Editor now, Oh Yeh Canva is good"

***Ring... Ring... Ring...***

suddenly the phone which is placed on the table starts to ring.
*'Oh, Why this genius calling me, Is he want to mock me that I'm unable to get a single interview yet'*

"Alright, I'm picking"

"Hey Harsh, How are you do'in?"
*cheerful voice could be heared from the other end.*

"Hey Yash, I'm really annoyed right now So please don't starts braging about yourself"
*He said with very annoyed voice*

"Alright Man, but why are you so annoyed"
*worrieness could be felt from that voice*

"Man, My resumes are not getting sortlisted so I wants to change the content but I'm unable to find the resumes. I don't maintence my google drive that well. I don't know but it's always full and show red color and You know that I start to hate red color after doing Competetive programming"

"That the reason why I'm so annoyed"
*He Said with very frustrated voice*

"So Simple, You can use Animre website. You can put your resume there and You can edit them when ever you like simple All things in one place"
*cheerful voice could be heared from other end again*

"Ha, Ha Why should I use that, It's very simple to edit resume on canvas and upload that on google drive"
*He said with the voice full of mockery*

"Well, I don't usually share this information with other but as you are good friend of mine. I will share that with you"
*Calmness could be felt from the voice*

"What! SECRET OF GENIUS!"
*He screamed*

"Nah, Well most of the student like us share resumes link on Linkedin or share in chat. I also use to do that then, when I found that website. I started using it's analytic function where I could see What attract the HR or other's the most, with this help. I improved my resume and get sortlisted"

"That is Amazing, What type of data we get?"
*He said with cheerful and doubtful voice*

"Like We are looking for a SDE roles and We don't usually have a exprience so We mostly put our projects, Coding profile, and Github profile or other profiles but We don't know that, they are even checking our profiles. So I try to understand What they don't like and why they don't like it."

"When I use that website I found that They are not even checking my projects because I don't describe the project properly.
After some FIND -> IMPROVE -> FIND -> ...  I finally getting started to get some response. NOW HERE AM I WITH INTERNSHIP OFFER"

"That Not at all What is the best thing about it, is that. It's an open source project and when we contribute we will get a tag which will show on the bottom of our name. When someone open our resume, they can see that we also contribute in this project."

"Amazing Yash, Just Amazing. So that's how, you get that Internship"

"Well Yes" (In a Low Voice)
"Anyway why you call me?"
*He said with annoying face again*

"Well, I'm starting my internship soon so I want to spend sometime with my best buddies"
*Sadness could be felt from the voice*

"Alright, I will meet you, but now I have to create Account on that website so you as well hang the call. I don't have a internship, you know that don't you?"
*He said with the most shameless face he could master.*

"Hey Man, Can't you be more polite I was the one that told you about that website. I just want to spend some time with you"
*Anoyness could be felt from the voice*

"Okay, but can't you told about this earlier"
*He said with the frustrated voice.*

"Well If I tell you this earlier How can I became a genius of our batch"
*Arrogance could be felt from the voice*
